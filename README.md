# About Software Project Lab (SPL)
The Software Project Lab (SPL) is a practical course in our academic curriculum that allows students to apply theoretical knowledge in a team-based project environment. It simulates a real-world software development lifecycle—ranging from requirement gathering and system design to coding, testing, and deployment. SPL is not only a test of our technical skills, but also an exercise in communication, collaboration, and project management.

# Project Introduction: NSTU_QuickBill
NSTU_QuickBill is a collaborative group project developed during our 3rd year, 1st term as part of the Software Project Lab (SPL) course in the Software Engineering program at Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU). This project was designed to reflect real-world software development practices, emphasizing teamwork, planning, implementation, and problem-solving.

# Why NSTU_QuickBill?
The core objective of NSTU_QuickBill was to create a system that minimizes manual paperwork and administrative delays by offering a more efficient, transparent, and centralized platform for handling teacher-related financial transactions. The system was built to be intuitive and accessible, enabling administrative staff to manage, track, and process payments with ease and accuracy.

# What it additionally does?
In addition to financial management, the system also includes features to assign teachers to specific courses and appoint them as examiners for examinations—ensuring better coordination between departments and faculty responsibilities.
